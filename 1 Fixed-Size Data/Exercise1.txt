Exercise 1. Add the following definitions for x and y to DrRacketâ€™s definitions area: 
(define x 3)
(define y 4)
Now imagine that x and y are the coordinates of a Cartesian point. Write down an expression that computes the distance of this point to the origin, that is, a point with the coordinates (0,0).

Code:
(define (distance x y)
  (sqrt (+ (* x x) (* y y))))
  
 Test:
 > (distance 3 4)
