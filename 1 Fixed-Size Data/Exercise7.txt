Exercise 7. Boolean expressions can express some everyday problems. Suppose you want to decide whether today is an appropriate day to go to the mall. You go to the mall either if it is not sunny or if today is Friday (because that is when stores post new sales items).

Code:
(define sunny #true)
(define friday #false)
(define gomall
  (or sunny (not friday)))
  
Test:
> gomall
#true
