Exercise 15. Define ==>. The function consumes two Boolean values, call them sunny and friday. Its answer is #true if sunny is false or friday is true. Note Logicians call this Boolean operation implication, and they use the notation sunny => friday for this purpose.

  (or (string=? x "friday") (not (string=? y "sunny"))))
