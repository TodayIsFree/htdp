Exercise 12. Define the function cvolume, which accepts the length of a side of an equilateral cube and computes its volume. If you have time, consider defining csurface, too.

Code:
(define (cvolume x )
  (* (* x x) x))


Test:
> (cvolume 3)
27

Code:
(define (csurface x )
  (* (* x x) 6))
  
Test:
> (csurface 3)
54
