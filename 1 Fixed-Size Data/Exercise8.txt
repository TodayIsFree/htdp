Exercise 8. Add the following line to the definitions area:

    (define cat )

Create a conditional expression that computes whether the image is tall or wide. An image should be labeled "tall" if its height is larger than or equal to its width; otherwise it is "wide". See exercise 1 for how to create such expressions in DrRacket; as you experiment, replace the cat with a rectangle of your choice to ensure that you know the expected answer.

Code:
(define cat .)
(define cat-figure
  (if (>= (image-height cat) (image-width cat)) "tall" "wide"))
  
Test:
> cat-figure
"tall"
